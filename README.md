# BDD2Verilog

#### Feb 28, 2016

This tool reads a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) as input (in the blif format generated by [CUDD](http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/CUDD/cudd.pdf)), balances the input BDD and generates Verilog code corresponding to it. These codes may be used for designing power analysis attack resistant circuits.

This tool is a product of our works reported below:
* [Circuits and Synthesis Mechanism for Hardware Design to Counter Power Analysis Attacks, DSD 2014](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6927286/)
* [A BDD based Secure Hardware Design Method to Guard against Power Analysis Attacks, VDAT 2014](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6881088/)
